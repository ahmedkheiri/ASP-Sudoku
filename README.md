# The Algorithm Selection Problem for solving Sudoku with metaheuristics

This repository contains the data and code for the work on this paper to be presented at IEEE 2023 Congress on Evolutionary Computation.

Included are:
- Python scripts to create the feature space described. (\* *A Gurobi licences is required to extract full set of SAT reformulation features.*)
- Python scripts for each of the 4 algorithms used to solve the puzzles.
- Feature and performance data for 1000 Sudoku puzzles (further described in Data folder).
- Jupyter notebooks to generate the results discussed in the conference paper.
